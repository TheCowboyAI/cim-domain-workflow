## Conclusion

This implementation roadmap provides a structured approach to transforming the CIM workflow system from fragmented domain-specific implementations into a unified, mathematically sound workflow Domain. The 8-week timeline balances thorough implementation with business delivery needs, while the phased approach ensures continuous validation and risk mitigation.

The resulting system will provide a Category Theory-based foundation for all workflow operations across the CIM ecosystem, enabling powerful cross-domain workflows while maintaining the flexibility for domain-specific requirements through composition rather than inheritance.
